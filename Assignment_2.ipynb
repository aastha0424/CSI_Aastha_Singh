    "# ðŸ§ª Linked List Implementation and Testing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains how a singly linked list works using a custom Python implementation. A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. The structure is dynamic in nature and allows efficient insertion and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”— Class Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Node Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Node` class represents each element of the linked list. It has two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`data`**: Holds the value of the node.\n",
    "- **`next`**: A pointer to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new node is created, `data` is initialized to the given value, and `next` is set to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LinkedList Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LinkedList` class manages the entire structure of the linked list. It starts with a `head` pointer, which is initially `None`, indicating the list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. `add_node(data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Adds a new node containing `data` at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the list is empty (`head` is `None`), the new node becomes the head.\n",
    "- Otherwise, the method traverses the list until it reaches the last node and appends the new node after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. `delete_nth_node(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Deletes the node at the `n`th position (0-based index).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "- If `n` is 0, it removes the head node by pointing `head` to the next node.\n",
    "- For other values, it traverses the list to the `(n-1)`th node and changes its `next` pointer to skip over the `n`th node.\n",
    "- If `n` is beyond the length of the list, it either does nothing or raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. `print_list()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints the current state of the list from head to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traverses from the `head` node to the end.\n",
    "- Displays each node's `data`, followed by an arrow (`->`), ending with `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. `__len__()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the number of nodes in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starts from the `head` and counts nodes until it reaches the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§ª Test Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following operations were performed to test the linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Creating and Adding Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- A new linked list is created.\n",
    "- Elements `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`, and `50` are added one by one.\n",
    "- After each addition, the list is printed to verify the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Deleting Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 3rd node (index `2`, data `30`) is deleted.\n",
    "- Then, the 1st node (index `0`, data `10`) is deleted.\n",
    "- The list is printed after each deletion to confirm the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Deleting Non-Existent Node\n",
    "\n",
    "- An attempt is made to delete the node at position `10`, which is out of range.\n",
    "- The implementation handles this gracefully, either by ignoring it or raising a handled error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Deleting from an Empty List\n",
    "\n",
    "- A separate, empty linked list is created.\n",
    "- An attempt is made to delete a node from this empty list.\n",
    "- A `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message indicating the list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "After all operations, the final version of the linked list is printed. This verifies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node addition works as expected.\n",
    "- Node deletion works at different positions.\n",
    "- Errors are properly handled when the position is invalid or the list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ“ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates how singly linked lists are built and manipulated manually in Python. The operations of insertion, deletion, traversal, and length checking provide a clear understanding of how dynamic data structures work under the hood. Mastery of linked lists is essential for advancing to more complex data structures and algorithms.\n"
